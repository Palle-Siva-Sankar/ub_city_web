# UB City Interactive Commercial Sales Deck

This project is a browser-based, non-linear sales deck for commercial decision-makers:
- prospective retail tenants
- sponsorship and brand partners
- event promoters and venue operators

The experience is built to work both as:
- a live, screen-shared sales narrative
- a self-guided standalone destination link

## Core Business Objectives

- Drive retail leasing intent (flagship, inline, pop-up, F&B)
- Drive sponsorship inquiries with premium activation framing
- Drive venue and event booking requests

## Subject Choice Justification

This implementation uses **UB City Bengaluru** as the narrative subject while intentionally building a framework that generalizes to mega-mall sales operations.

### Why UB City was selected

- It provides a realistic mixed-use commercial environment (retail, dining, events, premium positioning).
- Publicly available media and brand-context assets made rapid prototyping and iteration practical.
- It allowed focus on the core product problem: replacing fragmented sales collateral with a single interactive commercial tool.

### How this framework generalizes to world-scale malls

- **UX/Sales First Design**: The UI is built specifically to address the questions a prospective tenant or sponsor asks, organized into linear "pitch" modules (Retail, Leasing, Events).
- **Responsive Layout & Smoothness**: Mobile users receive modified viewport sizes (`-webkit-fill-available`) and hardware-accelerated transitions (`translateZ(0)`) to maintain the cinematic feel (including correctly scaled video-backgrounds) without layout shifts or dropping frames.
- **Robust Media Delivery**: Video assets are served directly from reliable CDN nodes (e.g., Pexels) inside custom GPU-accelerated video containers that respect network speeds and graceful degradation. Overlapping videos in consecutive slides were removed to minimize browser composite load.
- **Module-first architecture**: storytelling and conversion modules are isolated by route (`Retail`, `Luxury`, `Events`, `Sponsorship`, `Leasing`, `Venues`) and can be re-skinned per property.
- **Data/content swap model**: core page shells and CTA funnels remain stable while media, stats, and tenant/event datasets can be replaced per mall.
- **Action-path consistency**: inquiry endpoints (`leasing`, `sponsorship`, `venue-booking`) are reusable across any large destination sales workflow.
- **Scalable navigation model**: non-linear exploration is already structured for large inventory and sub-module expansion.

In short, this submission demonstrates the **product system** required by mega-malls, even though the current content layer is UB City-branded.

## Information Architecture (Commercial-First)

- `Overview` (cinematic opening + immediate conversion CTAs)
- `Retail`, `Luxury`, `Dining`, `Entertainment`, `Events`
- `Sponsorship`, `Leasing`, `Venues`, `Demographics`
- Action intake flow: `Inquire` at `/inquire/:action`
  - `/inquire/leasing`
  - `/inquire/sponsorship`
  - `/inquire/venue-booking`

Consumer-style ecommerce modules remain in the codebase but are intentionally de-emphasized from the primary commercial journey.

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- React Router (v7 structured)
- Tailwind CSS v4 + custom design tokens/theme layer
- Motion (`motion/react`) for section and card transitions
- Vite build pipeline
- `@studio-freight/lenis` for cinematic smooth scrolling

## Design Decisions

- **Dark-Luxe Aesthetic**: Chosen to align with Apple and Hermès positioning, using deep shadows, translucent glassmorphism panes (`glass-pane`), and `Outfit`/`Inter` typography pairings.
- **Cinematic Pacing**: Implement autoplaying background videos and scroll-triggered reveals to ensure the tool acts as an immersive narrative rather than a static spreadsheet.
- **Non-Linear Navigation**: Implemented via a persistent floating `<SalesDock>` and Mega Menu, allowing executives to pivot the pitch based on the prospect's interests.
- **Performance Hardening**: Expensive animations degrade gracefully using `useReducedMotion`, and heavy 3D Spline assets are isolated to keep the Lighthouse score high.

## Setup Instructions

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## AI Tools Used -- Antigravity and Cursor

AI-assisted workflow tools include:
- **Ideation & Architecture**: Claude / Gemini used for layout/system ideation and sales-deck interaction patterns.
- **Asset Generation**: Generative AI tools (Midjourney/DALL-E implicitly) and Unsplash/Coverr for filling asset gaps where official high-res media is limited.
- **Content Crafting**: LLMs used for narrative copy iteration and generating robust mock data for tenants and events.

## Rubric Mapping

- **Visual & UX Design (30%)**: luxury-styled UI, cinematic hero sections, non-linear nav, module consistency
- **Technical Execution (25%)**: modular route architecture, reusable components, build/lint validation, responsive layouts
- **AI Integration (15%)**: AI-assisted content/asset strategy and interaction ideation
- **Storytelling & Strategy (15%)**: structured commercial narrative from impact to business action
- **Expandability (10%)**: dedicated modules for events/sponsorship/leasing/venues with scalable route structure
- **Attention to Detail (5%)**: CTA consistency, loading and fallback behavior, documentation quality

### Evaluator Quick Map

| Rubric Area | Where To Review In Product |
| --- | --- |
| Visual & UX Design | `Overview` hero, premium nav, module cards, cinematic section pacing |
| Technical Execution | Route modules in `src/app/routes.tsx`, shared media/components, hooks |
| AI Integration | AI-assisted visual and interaction direction documented in this README |
| Storytelling & Strategy | `Overview` -> `Retail/Luxury/Dining/Entertainment/Events` -> inquiry paths |
| Expandability | Dedicated modules: `Sponsorship`, `Leasing`, `Venues`, `Inquire` |
| Attention to Detail | Theme contrast fixes, route cleanup, CTA consistency, fallback media handling |

## Live Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)

1. **Opening (45 sec)**  
   Show `Overview` hero and explain the objective: replace fragmented PDF/video/spreadsheet sales process with one browser-native sales tool.

2. **Commercial Narrative (2 min)**  
   Navigate non-linearly through `Retail`, `Luxury`, `Dining`, `Entertainment`, `Events` and highlight cinematic storytelling + business relevance.

3. **Business Conversion (1.5 min)**  
   Trigger key CTA paths:
   - leasing (`/inquire/leasing`)
   - sponsorship (`/inquire/sponsorship`)
   - venue booking (`/inquire/venue-booking`)

4. **Phase 2 Expandability (1 min)**  
   Open `Sponsorship`, `Leasing`, `Venues` and explain modular architecture for future sub-modules.

5. **Technical + Performance (1 min)**  
   Summarize:
   - modular routes/components
   - fallback media strategy
   - animation/perf hardening choices
   - build and lint verification

## Interview Pitch (Short)

This project is designed as a sales operating system, not a static deck.  
It combines cinematic storytelling, non-linear exploration, and direct commercial conversion pathways so a single shared link can move a prospect from interest to action.

## Performance Tracking

Lighthouse performance check (mobile + desktop):

```bash
# keep dev server running in another terminal
npm run dev

# run checks and generate reports
npm run lh:check
```

Reports are generated in `lighthouse-reports/` as both HTML and JSON files.

## Deployment Checklist

- Deploy on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
- Confirm all primary CTAs route to inquiry actions
- Validate desktop and tablet layout behavior
- Run Lighthouse and optimize until score target is met
- Add deployed URL and screenshots to final submission notes

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Navigation is commercial-first and non-linear
- [ ] All core modules include direct conversion paths
- [ ] Inquiry actions work for leasing/sponsorship/venue booking
- [ ] Build and lint pass cleanly
- [ ] Performance and motion remain smooth on desktop/tablet
